This is like a breakthrough in my life, I've always had to wait for hours to make a Naan just for it to be gone in seconds. This is literally the same satisfaction from a good, fluffy flatbread without needing to wait for any dough rising. I made the one in the picture in the shape of a heart, coz it was Valentine's.

Prep time: 10 minutes<br>
Cooking time: 5 minutes<br>

### Ingredients for 1 large flatbread (I made a smaller one)
- [ ] 125g all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- [ ] 2 tsp salt
- [ ] 100g Greek yogurt
<hr>

### Steps
1. **Mix the dry ingredients:** In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt and baking soda.
2. **Add the wet ingredients:** Stir in the yogurt with a fork until it looks like a sticky, shaggy ball.
3. **Flatten:** Put the dough ball for one flatbread onto a flour surface and work it with your hand. Sprad it with the tips of your fingers until it's a relatively thin flat disc.
4. **Cook:**  
   Heat a skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat. 
   Cook it for 2-3 minutes until one side has brown spots and blisters.
   Cook the other side for another 1–2 minutes until it looks good.
5. **Finish:** Brush with garlic butter. Enjoy!
