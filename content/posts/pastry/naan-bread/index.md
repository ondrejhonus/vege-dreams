Cooking time: 10 minutes  

### Ingredients for 2 large naan
- [ ] 100 g all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)
- [ ] Pinch of salt
- [ ] 2 g baking powder (about ½ tsp)
- [ ] 1 g baking soda (a pinch, about ⅛ tsp)
- [ ] Pinch of sugar
- [ ] 2 tsp of olive oil
- [ ] 2 tbsp unsweetened yogurt
- [ ] 45 ml warm water (add gradually as needed)
- [ ] Olive oil or butter, for brushing

### Steps
1. **Mix the dry ingredients:** In a small bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar. Mix well.

2. **Add the wet ingredients:** Stir in olive oil and yogurt. Slowly add warm water until a soft, slightly tacky dough forms — you may not need all 45 ml.

3. **Knead:** On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.

4. **Rest:** Return the dough to the bowl, cover with a towel, and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.

5. **Shape:** Divide into 2 equal balls. Roll each into a teardrop or oval about ½ cm thick.

6. **Cook:**  
   Heat a skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat.  
   Cook naan for 1–2 minutes until bubbles appear, then flip.  
   Cook the other side for another 1–2 minutes until golden and blistered.

7. **Finish:** Brush with olive oil or vegan butter. Serve hot with your favorite curry or dip.
