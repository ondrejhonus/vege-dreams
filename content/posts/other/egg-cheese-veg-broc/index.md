This is a vegetable dish heavily inspired by my egg-cheese pasta recipe.

<div class="recipe" id="recipe">
Prep time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 20 minutes

### Ingredients
- [ ] 200g califlower florets (small pieces)
- [ ] 200g brocolli florets (small pieces)
- [ ] 100g red beans
- [ ] 2-3 egg yolks
- [ ] Your hard cheese of choice (About 50g)
- [ ] Salt and fresh black pepper to taste
<hr>

### Steps
1. **Boil water**: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
2. **Add califlower**: Add the califlower florets and cook for 5 minutes.
3. **Egg sauce**: While the califlower cooks, add the cheese into a bowl and mix it with the egg yolks. It should look like a very vibrant yellow paste. Add the salt and black pepper according to your taste.
4. **Add brocolli**: Add the brocolli florets to the same pot and cook for another 5 minutes.
5. **Add beans**: Add the red beans to the pot and cook for about a minute, just to heat them up.
6. **Drain veggies**: Drain the veggies, and put them back into the pot. Turn off the heat.
7. **Add egg-cheese sauce**: Add the egg-cheese sauce to the pot with the veggies, and mix often, the heat is off, beacause you'd scrable the eggs otherwise.
8. **Serve**:Serve hot, topped with extra grated hard cheese if desired.
