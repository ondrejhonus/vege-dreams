It's a peach... it's a cake... its peach cake! And on top of that (or bottom) it's inverted. It's also not dry like my sense of humor.

### Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment paper.
2. In a large skillet, melt 100g of butter over medium heat. Cook it while stirring with a rubber spatula until it turns a deep golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat, pour it into a bowl, and let it cool slightly.
3. In the same, now empty, pan, add the 40g butter, chicory syrup, and peanut butter. Stir until melted and well combined.
4. Pour mixture into the prepared cake pan, spreading it evenly. It will be a bit runny, this is fine.
5. Arrange the peach slices on top of the mixture in a circular pattern.
6. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add cocoa powder and mix well.
7. Grate an apple into the brown butter mixture, add milk, espresso, and mix until well combined.
8. Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
9. Pour the batter over the peaches in the cake pan, smoothing the top with a spatula.
10. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
11. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate. Remove the parchment paper.
12. Serve warm or at room temperature, optionally with whipped cream on the side.
