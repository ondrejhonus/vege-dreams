This is a concept for something that's not too sweet and something I can spread some peanut butter over as a snack for when I'm too depressed and procrastinate too much.
It's more savoury than sweet to be honest and it's like a cloud on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 60 minutes

### Ingredients
- [ ] 300 g all-purpose flour
- [ ] 2 tsp baking powder
- [ ] 1/2 tsp baking soda
- [ ] 1 tsp salt  
- [ ] 1 egg
- [ ] 100 ml milk (oat, soy, almond, cow, whatever)
- [ ] 2 tbsp oil (neutral) or melted butter
- [ ] 1 tsp lemon juice (to activate the powder + soda)
- [ ] 100g cherries, pitted and chopped
- [ ] 60 g chopped walnuts or any nut of choice

### Optional:
- Some honey or maple syrup for a bit of sweetness

### Steps
1. **Preheat oven:** Preheat the oven to 180ËšC and oil a loaf pan, or just plop it onto a lined baking tray.
2. **Dry:** In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. If using add the honey or syrup
3. **Wet:** In another bowl, beat the egg with milk, oil, lemon juice and if using than the honey/syrup too.
4. **Combine:** Add wet to dry, and add the cherries and walnuts. Mix until just combined, don't overmix, just so no dry flour remains.
5. **Bake:** Put into the loaf pan or on a baking tray and bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
6. **Let it cool:** Let it rest in the pan for like 10 minutes, then put it on rack or a plate and let cool completely.
