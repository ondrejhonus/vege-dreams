### Steps
1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and start cooking the pasta according to the package instructions.
2. While the pasta cooks, put the basil, garlic, hard cheese, nuts, olive oil into a high speed blender, squeeze lemon juice onto it and season with some salt.
3. Blend the mixture until it's a smooth paste. If it's too thick you can add a bit of pasta water into it and blend it more.
4. Pour water out of the pasta and add the pesto sauce onto the pasta in the pot and mix it well until it's all green. Don't really cook it coz the basil will loose its flavor.
5. Put onto a plate, top it with some hard cheese and enjoy this absolute beauty of a dish.
