I fell in love with this bread on my student exchange trip in Dublin, specifically <a href="https://www.aldi.ie/product/ballymore-crust-buttermilk-soda-bread-000000000000382196" alt="aldis buttermilk soda bread" target="_blank" title="Aldi's buttermilk soda bread">this one</a>. I give props to the sweet lady whose place I was staying at that gave me the recipe for it. I'll never forget that stay.

I never thought I could love bread, but here we are...

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 60 minutes

### Ingredients
- [ ] 250 g plain white flour  
- [ ] 250 g plain wholemeal flour  
- [ ] 1 tsp salt  
- [ ] 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda  
- [ ] 500 ml buttermilk  

### Steps
1. Preheat your oven to 180°C and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, combine the white flour, wholemeal flour, salt, and bicarbonate of soda.
    <p><strong>TIP: You can siv the flour beforehand to avoid clumps.</strong></p>
3. Add the buttermilk and mix everything together until you get a soft, shaggy dough. Don't overwork it.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it however you like—round is traditional.
5. Place the loaf on the prepared tray. Optionally, sprinkle a little flour on top and cut a deep cross to help it bake evenly.
6. Bake for 1 hour. The bread is done when it looks golden brown and when you tap the bottom and it sounds hollow.
7. Let it cool a little before slicing. Enjoy and best of luck!
