These are delicious, 3 ingredient (base), crunchy oat cookies you can make in about 20 minutes, and eat them 10x quicker than that. It also only dirties one bowl and one utensil (fork most likely)

Prep time: 5 minutes

Cooking time: 15 minutes

### Ingredients
- [ ] 2 Bananas
- [ ] 1 cup of oats (I eyeball it)

- [ ] ~20g chicory syrup (additional sweetness)
<hr>

### Steps
1. **Preheat oven**
    Preheat your oven to 180˚C and line your baking tray with parchment paper.

2. **Mash bananas:**  
   In a medium-large bowl, mash up the 2 bananas, until they're sludge. If using, add in the chicory syrup.

3. **Mix the dry:**  
   Add the oats, grated coconut and optionally cocoa powder in. mix it all until it's a thick, but not crumbly "dough", if using, sprinkle in the chocolate chips.

4. **Scoop:**  
   Take an ice-cream scooper (or if you're build different just use hands) and make golf ball sized balls onto your tray and flatten them a bit because they won´t really expand much.

5. **Bake**
    Put the cookies in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until they're a bit golden on the top (if you're using cocoa powder, they're not gonna brown, so just until they're hard when you tap them).
