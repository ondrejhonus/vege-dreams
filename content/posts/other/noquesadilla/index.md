### Steps
1. **Make the wrap batter:** 
combine the grated carrot, sweet potato and egg in one bowl and season it with salt and pepper
2. **Fry the wrap:**
Pour the batter onto a hot pan and spread it all around to form a circle. Fry it for about a minute on each side, or until you see it browning.
3. **Prepare the vegedilla:**  Spread white yogurt and hummus on the whole wrap then put all the vegetables and tofu on ONE HALF of the wrap (because you need to close it lol).
4. **Finishing steps:** Close the veggedilla and top it with some fresh herbs if you'd like. Enjoy!!!
