I got tired of buying a whole pack of tortillas only for them to get hard and bad in a few days, because i can't eat all of them. So i found out that it takes 4 ingredients to make your own, instead of the 50 ingredients and chemicals you get at the store.

<div class="recipe" id="recipe">
Prep time: 25 minutes + 30 minutes dough rest

Cooking time: 20 minutes

### Ingredients for 5 tortillas
- [ ] 400 g all-purpose flour 
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] 5g baking powder
- [ ] 40 g unsalted butter (It's good if you let it soften)
- [ ] 120 ml hot water
- [ ] Vegetable / olive oil for resting the dough

### Steps
1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, and baking powder.  
2. **Add butter and mix:** Add the softened butter and start mixing it in with your hands until you have a sandy-like mixture.
3. **Start adding water:** Carefully start adding the hot water bit-by-bit and mix as you go. Don't burn your hands tho. You know you're done when a sticky dough ball forms
4. **Knead:** Transfer the dough ball to a clean flat surface and kned the dough for about 5 minutes. The dough will get less sticky gradually and when you're done it should be pretty elastic.
5. **Separate dough balls:** Pinch off golf ball sized portions and roll them into a ball.
6. **Let the dough rest:** Lightly oil a platter and put the dough balls on it just so they aren't touching and cover with an oiled sheet of plastic (oiled so it doesn't stick to the dough). Let it rest for about 30 minutes
7. **Preheat pan:** Before you start rolling out your tortillas, start preheating a large non-stick pan.
8. **Roll out tortillas:** Flour your working surface, put a dough ball on it and flatten the ball with your hand. Start rolling it out until you have a paper thin tortilla
TIP: Rotate your tortilla between rolls for an even roll and flip it gradually so you avoid the edges curling up.
9. **Put it in a pan:** Put the tortilla on the hot pan. The tortilla is going to be done very fast so be careful if you're rolling out the next one while the previous one is cooking.
10. **Serve:** Serve immediately or store in a plastic bag after cooling down for up to 3 days.
