This is a very simple pasta recipe. It's easy, comforting, and always hits the spot. I usually make it with penne instead of spaghetti because I love penne lol. I call this my fancy depression meal.

### Ingredients
- [ ] A portion of pasta

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package instructions.
2. While the pasta cooks, heat a bit of olive oil in a pan.

4. If using, add the diced carrots and bell pepper shortly after the onion and garlic. Cook until softened.
