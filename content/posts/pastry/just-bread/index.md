This is bread... Yup, pretty simple, just gotta wait 2 hours for it to rise. It's good, it's simple, its bread.

<div class="recipe" id="recipe">
Prep time: 2 hours

Baking time: 30 minutes

### Ingredients
- [ ] 300g All-purpose flour
- [ ] 100g Whole wheat flour  
- [ ] 9g salt  
- [ ] 330g warm water (~40°C) 
- [ ] 7g dry yeast
- [ ] 7g honey
<hr>

### Steps
1. **Dry:** In a large bowl, combine the white flour, whole wheat flour and salt.
    <p><strong>TIP: You can siv the flour beforehand to avoid clumps.</strong></p>
2. **Yeast:** In a separate bowl, pour the warm water in (Don't let it be over 50C) and stir in the dry yeast and honey. Let it sit for ~5 minutes, until it becomes foamy on top.
3. **Mix:** Pour the yeast water into the flour bowl and mix it all up until the flour is all hydrated, it will be a sticky mess.
4. **Knead:** Turn the dough onto a clean floured surface, and knead for about 5-8 minutes. The goal is to have a smooth, elastic, slightly sticky dough.
    <p><strong>TIP: If it's sticking to your hands a lot, rub a little olive oil onto clean palms.</strong></p>
5. **Let rise:** Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a towel and let it sit for ~2hrs at room temperature.
6. **Prepare for baking:** Gently deflate the dough and transfer it to a baking sheet, or an oiled bread pan and slice a ~1cm deep line across the top with a sharp knife.
7. **Bake:** Bake for ~30 minutes, or until it's slightly golden at the top. Another way to know it's done is by picking it up and tapping the bottom. If it sounds hollow, it's done.
8. **Wait:** This is the hardest part of baking, wait for at least 20 minutes to let it cool down. If you cut it too soon, the inside will become rough and gummy.
