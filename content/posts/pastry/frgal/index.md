A traditional Czech pie that is close to my heart. It's not as hard to make as it may seem and it's quite a fun recipe. Sooo simple to make vegan too!

There is a variety of different fillings you can use, in this recipe I will show you how to make a plum jam version and a pear version. However, there is a hoast of other possible options and you can find them readily online. 

<i>Tip: The dough can be quite sticky, so make sure to flour your hands and the surface you are working on.</i>

<i>Tip: Homemade jams vary in thickness and sweetness, adjust accordingly.</i>
