This is a delicious and healthy pasta recipe. It's vibrant, nourishing, and perfect for any day. I love making this with whole wheat pasta for an extra boost, but any pasta works great!

Prep time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: 25 minutes

### Ingredients
- [ ] Pasta, whole wheat is the best for this, but any works
- [ ] 1 medium sweet potato, diced
- [ ] 1 carrot, grated or diced
- [ ] 1 small bell pepper, thinly sliced
- [ ] 1 small red onion, diced
- [ ] 2–3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] A squeeze of lemon juice
- [ ] Olive oil
- [ ] Herbs of choice: eg. thyme, oregano, parsley, basil
- [ ] Salt + pepper
- [ ] Hard cheese of choice

#### Optional Ingredients
- [ ] A pinch of chili flakes
- [ ] Sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, or toasted breadcrumbs

### Steps
1. **Roast the Sweet Potato**  Preheat oven to 200°C. Toss sweet potato with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes until tender. If you're depressed like me, microwave the potato for 3 minutes on each side in a wet paper towel, but that's only for the ones that gave up on life like me :\).
2. **Cook the Pasta:** Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve some pasta water, then drain.
3. **Sauté the Veggies**  In a large pan, heat olive oil. Add minced garlic and diced onion and let it sizzle until fragrant (don’t burn it!).  
    Add grated carrot and bell pepper, cooking until softened but still with a bit of texture, not limpy.
    Add a splash of pasta water to create a silky coating.

4. **Assemble it**  
    Add the roasted sweet potato to the pan.  
    Toss in the cooked pasta.  
    Mix everything until coated, glossy, and well combined.
    If it looks too dry, add the reserver pasta water.
    Add a squeeze of lemon juice for a fresh taste.
    Season with salt, pepper, herbs, and chili flakes if desired.

5. **Finishing move**  
    Sprinkle with your favourite hard cheese.  
    Add the last optional ingredients as a cherry on the top.
