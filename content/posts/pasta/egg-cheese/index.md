This is another simple pasta recipe, It's heavily inspired by Carbonara, but it has no guanciale. It can be messed up, but it still won't taste bad if you do. The only downside is that you only use egg yolks, so you have extra egg whites.

### Steps
1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package instructions.
2. While the pasta cooks, grate a generous ammount of hard cheese into a bowl and mix it with the 2 egg yolks. It should look like a very vibrant yellow paste.
3. Add the salt and black pepper according to your taste.
4. Drain the pasta water, but save some for later.
5. Put the spaghetti back into the pot, but without water and add the cheese-egg sauce.
6. Start mixing, don't stop (you don't want scrambled eggs) and slowly add the saved pasta water.
7. Mix until the sauce looks light yellow and is creamy.
5. Serve hot, topped with grated Parmiggiano Reggiano and optional mozzarella if desired.
