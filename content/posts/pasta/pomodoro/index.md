This is a surprisingly delicious pasta recipe that I learnt off of some italian influencers. I tried my best to follow as closely as possible to keep the italian tradition.

### Steps
1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and start cooking the pasta according to the package instructions.
2. While the pasta cooks, heat a tsp of olive oil in a pan.
3. Add the garlic pieces and sear them for a minute (not until golded brown, coz they're going to burn if you sear them too much).
5. Put the whole cherry tomatoes into the pan and let it simmer for a few minutes until the tomatoes soften and you can then mash them into a sauce.
6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste, also put cut up basil and oregano and stir it in.
7. Add the cooked pasta to the pan with the sauce, reserve pasta water. Mix it all together, if it feels too dry, put some pasta water into it.
8. Put onto a plate and top if with some hard cheese. Enjoy the authentic pasta pomodoro!
