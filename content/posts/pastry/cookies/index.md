    Preheat your oven to 180˚C and line your baking tray with parchment paper.

   In a bowl, mash up the 2 bananas, add the peanut butter and chicory syrup and mix it well until u have a brownish paste.

3. **Mix the dry:**  
   In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and cinnamon

   Add the wet to the dry gradually, also add in the chocolate chips. Combine until u have a big ball of cookie dough

5. **Scoop:**  
   Take an ice-cream scooper (or if you're build different just use hands) and make golf ball sized balls onto your tray and flatten them a bit because they won´t really expand much.

6. **Top it off:**  
    Add a round slice of banana to each cookie and push it in a bit.

7. **Bake**
    Put the cookies in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until they're a bit golden on the top
