This is another simple pasta recipe, It's heavily inspired by Carbonara, but it has no guanciale. It can be messed up, but it still won't taste bad if you do. The only downside is that you only use egg yolks, so you have extra egg whites.

### Ingredients
- [ ] A portion of pasta
- [ ] 2 egg yolks
- [ ] Your hard cheese of choice

4. Drain the pasta water, but save some for later.
5. Put the spaghetti back into the pot, but without water and add the cheese-egg sauce.
6. Start mixing, don't stop (you don't want scrambled eggs) and slowly add the saved pasta water.
7. Mix until the sauce looks light yellow and is creamy.
5. Serve hot, topped with grated Parmiggiano Reggiano and optional mozzarella if desired.
